Parkour WOD Generator takes the latency out of training. There are many WOD apps out there, but this is the very first that focuses on a parkour athletes needs. The generated workouts and moves allow for substantial strength gains while not bulking the user up. It focuses on being a guide for a variety of workouts and movements and it does it well. Users can select the type of workout they want to do and if they want to include weights or other gym/ expensive equipment, but when they need a workout fast, they aren't forced to randomly generate workouts till they find one that satisfy their constraints. Personally, I have been wanting this app for years, so it has been a very rewarding experience building it and am eager to implement future changes to make it all the better! Some features I look forward to are logging and favoriting workouts, being able to question/ comment moves and workouts, and integrate maps for meets/ training spots. Stay tunes as the app gets better and better!
