Spoiler Alert helps track food items in your pantry, where you set a life-time for them. The big idea is to prevent food waste by allowing the user to know what items they are tracking and when they expire to plan menus and trips to the store as necessary. Users have virtual pantries so they save themselves a trip home to inventory their food. Future implementations include push notifications, more robust features, and more. This was a group project with cohort-mates in our time at galvanize, where we had only 10 days to build a CRUDable full-stack app.
